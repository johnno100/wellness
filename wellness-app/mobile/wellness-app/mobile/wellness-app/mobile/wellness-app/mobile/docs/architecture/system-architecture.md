# System Architecture

This document outlines the overall system architecture of the Wellness App, detailing the components, interactions, and design decisions that form the foundation of the application.

## Architecture Overview

The Wellness App follows a modern, cloud-native architecture that emphasizes scalability, maintainability, and extensibility. The system consists of several key components:

## Core Components

### 1. Mobile Application

The client-facing mobile application built with React Native that provides the primary user interface.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Cross-platform support (iOS and Android)
- Offline-first design with data synchronization
- Responsive UI with performance optimization
- Modular component architecture

**Technical Stack:**
- React Native
- Redux + Redux Toolkit for state management
- React Navigation for screen navigation
- Axios for API communication
- AsyncStorage for local data persistence

### 2. Backend API Services

The core server components that handle business logic, data processing, and external integrations.

**Key Characteristics:**
- RESTful API design
- Stateless architecture for horizontal scaling
- Domain-driven design approach
- Comprehensive error handling and validation

**Technical Stack:**
- Node.js runtime
- Express.js framework
- Winston for logging
- JWT for authentication
- Helmet for security headers

### 3. Database Layer

The persistence layer built on Neo4j graph database to store and manage all application data.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Graph data model for complex relationships
- Highly connected data representation
- Efficient querying of related health domains
- Flexible schema for evolving data requirements

**Technical Stack:**
- Neo4j 5.x Enterprise
- Cypher query language
- Neo4j-driver for Node.js
- Connection pooling for performance

### 4. External API Integrations

Connections to third-party services that provide specialized health data.

**Integrated Services:**
- Sahha.ai for mental health tracking
- Asleep.ai for sleep monitoring
- Passio.ai for nutrition tracking
- Strava for fitness and activity data

**Integration Pattern:**
- Adapter services for each external API
- Normalized data models across providers
- Cached responses for reliability
- Rate limiting compliance

## Infrastructure Architecture

### Cloud Infrastructure

The application is designed to run on cloud infrastructure, with support for AWS or Azure.

**Key Components:**
- Container orchestration with Kubernetes
- Load balancing for API services
- Managed database services
- CDN for static assets
- Blob storage for user data

**Deployment Topology:**
- Multiple environments (development, staging, production)
- Regional distribution for low latency
- Active monitoring and alerting

### DevOps Pipeline

A comprehensive CI/CD pipeline ensures reliable building, testing, and deployment.

**Pipeline Stages:**
1. Code validation (linting, formatting)
2. Test execution (unit, integration, E2E)
3. Security scanning
4. Build and containerization
5. Deployment to target environment
6. Post-deployment verification

**Tools:**
- GitHub Actions for workflow automation
- Docker for containerization
- SonarCloud for code quality
- Codecov for test coverage

## Data Flow

### Authentication Flow

1. User enters credentials in the mobile app
2. Mobile app sends authentication request to backend
3. Backend validates credentials against stored user data
4. On success, backend generates JWT tokens and returns to client
5. Mobile app stores tokens for subsequent requests
6. Refresh token mechanism handles token expiration

### Health Data Sync Flow

1. User connects to external service (e.g., Strava)
2. Backend obtains authorization from external service
3. Backend periodically polls or receives webhooks with new data
4. Data is processed, normalized, and stored in Neo4j
5. Mobile app syncs with backend to display latest data
6. Cross-domain insights are calculated based on combined data

### Offline Synchronization

1. Mobile app stores user actions in local queue when offline
2. Upon reconnection, queued actions are sent to backend
3. Backend processes actions in order received
4. Conflict resolution strategy applied for overlapping changes
5. Updated data synced back to mobile app

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling

- API services can scale independently based on demand
- Database read replicas for query scaling
- Stateless design enables adding more instances

### Vertical Scaling

- Database instance sizing based on data volume and query complexity
- Memory optimization for Neo4j performance
- Resource allocation based on usage patterns

### Performance Optimizations

- API response caching
- Database query optimization
- Connection pooling
- Batch processing for data synchronization

## Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization

- JWT-based authentication with short-lived tokens
- Role-based access control for API endpoints
- Secure token storage on mobile devices
- OAuth 2.0 for third-party service integration

### Data Protection

- Encryption of sensitive data at rest
- TLS for all data in transit
- Sanitization of user inputs
- Parameterized queries to prevent injection

### API Security

- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- CORS configuration
- Security headers (CSP, X-XSS-Protection)
- Regular dependency vulnerability scanning

## Monitoring & Observability

### Logging

- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Log aggregation in central service
- Error tracking and alerting

### Metrics

- API response times
- Database query performance
- Mobile app performance metrics
- Business KPIs (user engagement, retention)

### Alerting

- Threshold-based alerts for critical metrics
- Error rate monitoring
- Infrastructure health checks
- On-call rotation for incidents

## Disaster Recovery

### Backup Strategy

- Regular database backups
- Point-in-time recovery capability
- Geo-replicated storage for disaster resilience

### Recovery Procedures

- Documented recovery processes
- Regular recovery testing
- Automated recovery for common failures
- Manual intervention procedures for complex scenarios

## Future Architecture Evolution

The architecture is designed to evolve over time, with planned expansions including:

1. **Microservices Decomposition** - Breaking down monolithic API into domain-specific services
2. **Event-Driven Architecture** - Implementing event bus for asynchronous processing
3. **Machine Learning Pipeline** - Adding predictive analytics capabilities
4. **Real-Time Collaboration** - Supporting multi-user features and social connectivity
5. **Edge Computing** - Pushing computation closer to users for improved performance
