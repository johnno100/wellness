# Comprehensive Testing Strategy for Wellness App

This document outlines our multi-layered testing approach for the Wellness App, ensuring high quality, reliability, and maintainability throughout the development lifecycle.

## 1. Testing Principles

Our testing strategy follows these core principles:

1. **Shift-Left Testing**: Catch issues as early as possible in the development cycle
2. **Test Pyramid Approach**: Higher volume of unit tests, fewer integration tests, fewer E2E tests
3. **Automated First**: Maximize test automation to enable CI/CD and rapid development
4. **Isolation**: Tests should be independent and repeatable
5. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Cover both frontend and backend with appropriate testing types
6. **Performance Focus**: Include performance testing as a first-class concern

## 2. Test Types and Coverage Targets

### 2.1 Unit Tests

**Target Coverage**: 80% line coverage minimum

#### Backend Unit Tests
- Service layer: 90%+ coverage
- Controller layer: 80%+ coverage
- Model layer: 80%+ coverage
- Utility functions: 90%+ coverage
- API adapters: 90%+ coverage

#### Mobile Unit Tests
- Redux reducers: 100% coverage
- Redux selectors: 90%+ coverage 
- Service layer: 90%+ coverage
- Utility functions: 90%+ coverage
- Pure components: 80%+ coverage

### 2.2 Integration Tests

**Target Coverage**: Key user flows and API integrations

#### Backend Integration Tests
- API endpoint testing (all routes)
- Database integration (Neo4j interactions)
- External API integration (mocked responses)
- Authentication/authorization flow testing
- Error handling and edge cases

#### Mobile Integration Tests
- Redux store integration
- Navigation flows
- Screen interactions
- API service integrations
- Storage persistence

### 2.3 End-to-End Tests

**Target Coverage**: Critical user journeys

- User authentication
- Dashboard data display
- API data synchronization
- Health domain-specific flows
- Setting changes and preferences

### 2.4 Performance and Load Tests

- API endpoint response times (<200ms target)
- Database query performance
- Mobile app startup time
- Data synchronization performance
- Concurrent user simulation

### 2.5 Security Tests

- Authentication mechanism testing
- Authorization boundary testing
- Input validation and sanitization
- API security (rate limiting, CORS)
- Dependency vulnerability scanning

## 3. Testing Tools and Technologies

### 3.1 Backend Testing

- **Unit Testing**: Jest
- **API Testing**: Supertest
- **Mocking**: Jest mock functions, mock-service-worker
- **Database Testing**: neo4j-testcontainers
- **Security Testing**: OWASP ZAP, npm audit
- **Performance Testing**: Autocannon, k6

### 3.2 Mobile Testing

- **Unit Testing**: Jest with React Testing Library
- **Component Testing**: React Native Testing Library
- **E2E Testing**: Detox
- **Visual Testing**: Storybook with Chromatic
- **Performance Testing**: React Native Performance Monitor
- **Mocking**: Jest mock functions, MSW

### 3.3 CI/CD Testing Tools

- **Test Runner**: GitHub Actions / GitLab CI
- **Coverage Reporting**: Codecov
- **Static Analysis**: ESLint, TypeScript, SonarQube
- **Test Management**: Xray (Jira)
- **Visual Regression**: Percy

## 4. Test Data Strategy

### 4.1 Test Data Generation

- **Mock Data Factory**: Use faker.js to generate realistic test data
- **Snapshot Testing**: For UI components and API responses
- **Fixtures**: Pre-defined test datasets for specific scenarios
- **Seeded Random Data**: Deterministic but varied test data

### 4.2 Test Data Management

- Test data isolated by environment
- Reset database state between test runs
- Mock external APIs with recorded responses
- Version-controlled test fixtures

## 5. Testing Workflow

### 5.1 Development Testing

1. Developers write unit tests alongside code
2. Pre-commit hooks run linting and unit tests
3. Pull requests trigger automated test runs
4. Code review includes test review

### 5.2 CI/CD Pipeline Testing

1. **Build Stage**: Static analysis and unit tests
2. **Integration Stage**: Integration tests with containerized dependencies
3. **Deployment Stage**: Deployment to test environment
4. **Verification Stage**: E2E tests, performance tests
5. **Security Stage**: Security scanning
6. **Production Stage**: Smoke tests post-deployment

### 5.3 Regression Testing

- Full regression suite runs nightly
- Critical path tests run on each deployment
- Visual regression runs on UI changes

## 6. Testing Environments

### 6.1 Local Development

- Docker Compose for local dependencies
- Mock external APIs by default
- Hot reloading for quick feedback

### 6.2 CI Environment

- Ephemeral infrastructure for each build
- Containerized dependencies (Neo4j, etc.)
- Mocked external dependencies with option for real integration tests

### 6.3 Testing Environment

- Mirrors production configuration
- Connected to test instances of external APIs
- Used for E2E and performance testing

### 6.4 Production Environment

- Restricted to smoke tests
- Canary testing for new features
- Synthetic monitoring

## 7. Test Monitoring and Reporting

### 7.1 Test Result Reporting

- Test results published to team dashboard
- Coverage trends tracked over time
- Test failures trigger notifications

### 7.2 Test Performance Metrics

- Test execution time tracking
- Flaky test identification
- Test maintenance cost tracking

## 8. Continuous Improvement

### 8.1 Test Retrospectives

- Regular review of test effectiveness
- Identification of testing gaps
- Test suite optimization

### 8.2 Test Debt Management

- Tracking and prioritization of test improvements
- Regular refactoring of test code
- Update test strategies as application evolves

## 9. Quality Gates

Each stage of the development process includes specific quality gates that must be passed before code can proceed:

### 9.1 Pre-commit Quality Gates
- All unit tests pass
- Code linting passes with no errors
- Type checking passes (TypeScript)
- No security vulnerabilities in dependencies

### 9.2 PR Quality Gates
- Maintain or improve code coverage
- Integration tests pass
- No new technical debt
- Code review approval by at least one peer

### 9.3 Deployment Quality Gates
- End-to-end tests pass
- Performance benchmarks meet targets
- Security scans pass
- Smoke tests in staging environment pass

## 10. Testing Responsibilities

### 10.1 Development Team
- Write and maintain unit tests
- Write integration tests for new features
- Fix failing tests in their area of responsibility
- Participate in test planning for new features

### 10.2 QA Team
- Design and maintain end-to-end test suites
