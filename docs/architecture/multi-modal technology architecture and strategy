# Multimodal Wellness Application: Technology Architecture & Development Strategy

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive technology architecture and development strategy for a cutting-edge multimodal wellness application that integrates nutrition, sleep, activity tracking, and community features. The proposed architecture leverages modern cloud-native technologies while maintaining a pragmatic approach to risk management, creating a foundation that balances innovation with reliability.

The architecture employs a microservices-based backend powered by Node.js, a React Native mobile application, and a Neo4j graph database to create rich relationships between wellness data points. This technology stack enables powerful cross-domain insights while maintaining the flexibility to scale individual components as user adoption grows.

### Data Architecture

The application leverages Neo4j's graph database capabilities to model complex relationships between different health domains:

```
User --(HAS_MENTAL_HEALTH)--> MentalHealth
User --(HAS_SLEEP)--> Sleep
User --(HAS_NUTRITION)--> Nutrition
User --(HAS_FITNESS)--> Fitness
```

This graph structure enables:
- Relationship-based queries across domains
- Discovery of correlations between different health aspects
- Community features with social graph capabilities
- Future AI/ML implementation for personalized insights
