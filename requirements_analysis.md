# Wellness App MVP Requirements Analysis

## Layered Architecture Approach

Based on the knowledge items, our wellness app should implement a layered architecture approach including:

1. **Data Layer**: Responsible for aggregating information from wearables, apps, and user inputs
   - Will integrate with sahha.ai, asleep.ai, passio.ai, and Strava APIs
   - Must handle different data formats and synchronization
   - Should store data in Neo4j for relationship mapping between different health metrics

2. **Assessment Layer**: For clinical evaluation of health status
   - Will analyze data from integrated APIs
   - Should provide insights based on collected data
   - Must support evaluation of sleep, nutrition, and physical activity metrics

3. **Conversational Layer**: For therapeutic interactions
   - Optional for MVP but architecture should support future addition
   - Could provide recommendations based on health data

4. **Orchestration Layer**: For coordinating between components
   - Will manage data flow between different APIs and database
   - Should handle authentication and authorization
   - Must implement proper error handling and retry mechanisms

5. **Interface Layer**: Providing unified multimodal experiences
   - Will present data from all integrated APIs in a cohesive manner
   - Should support different interaction methods (initially focused on visual UI)
   - Must be designed for future expansion to voice and other modalities

## Multimodal Interface Requirements

For the MVP, we'll focus on the visual interface, but the architecture should support:

1. **Multiple Input Modalities**: Including text, voice, visual, and sensor data from wearables
2. **Cross-modal Integration**: With seamless transitions between modalities and context preservation
3. **Consistent User Experience**: Across all interaction methods
4. **Accessibility Features**: For users with various disabilities
5. **Personalization Capabilities**: That adapt to user communication preferences
6. **Privacy Controls**: Specific to each modality with clear consent mechanisms

## Integration Requirements

The MVP will integrate with the following APIs:

1. **sahha.ai**: Mental health and wellness tracking
2. **asleep.ai**: Sleep tracking and analysis
3. **passio.ai**: Nutrition tracking and food recognition
4. **Strava**: Physical activity and exercise tracking

Each integration must:
- Follow proper authentication protocols
- Handle data synchronization
- Implement error handling
- Store relevant data in Neo4j
- Present unified data to users

## 12Factor Principles Implementation

The application will follow 12Factor.net principles:

1. **Codebase**: One codebase tracked in Git
2. **Dependencies**: Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies
3. **Config**: Store config in the environment
4. **Backing Services**: Treat backing services as attached resources
5. **Build, Release, Run**: Strictly separate build and run stages
6. **Processes**: Execute the app as one or more stateless processes
7. **Port Binding**: Export services via port binding
8. **Concurrency**: Scale out via the process model
9. **Disposability**: Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown
10. **Dev/Prod Parity**: Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible
11. **Logs**: Treat logs as event streams
12. **Admin Processes**: Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes

## Neo4j Database Requirements

The Neo4j database will:
- Store user profiles
- Track relationships between different health metrics
- Store data from all integrated APIs
- Support complex queries across different health domains
- Enable visualization of health data relationships
- Provide insights based on connected data

## MVP Scope

For the initial MVP, we will:
1. Implement basic integration with all four APIs
2. Create a simple UI to display data from each API
3. Store data in Neo4j with basic relationship modeling
4. Follow 12Factor principles for deployment flexibility
5. Provide documentation for future expansion
